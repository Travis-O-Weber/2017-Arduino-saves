README for singlesero.ino

Description

This Arduino sketch reads a single value from a sensor and prints it to the serial monitor.

How It Works

Sets the sensor pin to INPUT mode in the setup() function.

Reads the sensor value using analogRead().

Prints the read value to the serial monitor.

Hardware Requirements

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)

Sensor (e.g., potentiometer, light sensor, etc.)

Breadboard and jumper wires

Circuit Setup

Connect the sensor's signal pin to an analog pin (e.g., A0).

Connect the sensor's power pin to 5V.

Connect the sensor's ground pin to GND.

Code Explanation

analogRead(A0): Reads the sensor value from pin A0.

Serial.print(): Displays the value on the serial monitor.

How to Upload

Open the Arduino IDE.

Load the singlesero.ino file.

Connect your Arduino board to the computer.

Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.

Click the upload button.

Sample Output

Sensor value: 523

Notes

Ensure the correct pin number is specified if not using A0.

Adjust the sensor connection according to the specific sensor type.
